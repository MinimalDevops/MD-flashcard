The four main principles of OOP are:

- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit
- Inheritance: The mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class
- Polymorphism: The ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms (data types or classes)
- Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object

## Card: REST API [Category: Web Development]

### Front

What is a REST API and what are its key characteristics?

### Back

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications.

Key characteristics include:
- Stateless: Each request contains all necessary information
- Client-Server: Separation of concerns between client and server
- Cacheable: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not
- Uniform Interface: Standardized way to communicate between client and server
- Layered System: Client cannot tell if it's connected directly to the server

Common HTTP methods used:
- GET: Retrieve data
- POST: Create new data
- PUT/PATCH: Update existing data
- DELETE: Remove data
